General MySQL Setup Notes
=========================

Download the free, "community" edition of MySQL.  
You need the "server" for your OS/version.
(My Linux version of firefox actually had problems
with the MySQL download site, but when I fetched
the file with Safari, that went fine...)

I also needed to install perl DBI.
For Linux, I prefer the non-RPM package,
which one can install under /usr/local
like this:

# Initial install
cd /usr/local
tar vzxf mysql-.....
ln -s /usr/local/mysql-5.0.51a-linux-i686-glibc23 /usr/local/mysql
groupadd mysql
useradd mysql
cd /usr/local/mysql
./scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
chown -R root .
chown -R mysql data
chgrp -R mysql .


# Start the server
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

# Stop the server
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown


# Set password
./bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'

# Similar, via mysql
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p
... enter root password

SET PASSWORD FOR root@localhost=PASSWORD('new-password');
SET PASSWORD FOR root@'titan-terrier'=PASSWORD('new-password');


# Delete empty default user stuff
USE mysql;
DELETE FROM user WHERE User='';
DELETE FROM db WHERE User='';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

SELECT User, Host FROM user;
SELECT User, Host, Db FROM db;

 
# Add user 'fred' who can access the 'archive' tables
GRANT ALL ON archive.* TO fred IDENTIFIED BY '$fred';
