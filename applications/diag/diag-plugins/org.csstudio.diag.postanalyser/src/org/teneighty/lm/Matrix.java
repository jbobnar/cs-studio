/**
 * A simple (double precision) matrix interface.
 * <p>
 * See <code>MatrixFactory</code> for information on which implementation the
 * <code>LevenbergMarquardt</code> class will use.
 * <p>
 * <i>You do not need to implement this class!</i> A (very simple) default
 * implementation exists. This class exists to provide hooks for higher
 * performance matrix implementations; in fact, it's fairly trivial to wrap an
 * implementation of this interface around an existing (and higher performance)
 * matrix implementation. (You must also create an associated
 * <code>MatrixFactory</code> implementation, as well as setting some system
 * properties, but doing so is beyond trivial.) See the package manifest for
 * info on how precisely to do this.
 * <p>
 * Note that I choose to use this arrangement, rather than simply use an
 * existing matrix implementation, solely so that this package can be used
 * without an external requirements. At the same time, you can also substitute a
 * high-performance implementation with almost zero overhead. So, basically,
 * this give you, the user, the best of both worlds (in a non-hermaphroditic
 * way, with apologies to Randall).
