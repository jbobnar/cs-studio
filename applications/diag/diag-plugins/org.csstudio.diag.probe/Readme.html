This used to be de.desy.css.jprobe, which in turn is based on code
from Ken Evans.

<ul>
<li>Changed package name.
<li>Use org.csstudio.util.pv, removed local copies of CA client jars
     and Windows executables.
<li>Added icon.
<li>Added context menu oject contribution for 'PV'-type selections.
<li>One can 'drop' a PV name into the PV name text box.
    <p>
    'Drag' doesn't work because I cannot figure out how to get
    that from a text box. So far the 'drag' simply refuses to start,
    maybe because the Text box already handles all the mouse
    actions in a different way. <br>
    For similar reasons, I so far didn't get a context menu added to the Text box.
</ul>
