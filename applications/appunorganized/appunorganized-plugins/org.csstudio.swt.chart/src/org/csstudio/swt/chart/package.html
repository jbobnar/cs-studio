A plot library.
<p>
Most important classes:
<ul>
<li>Sample - a single sample
<li>SampleSequence - a sequence of Sample entries<br>
              The chart user must provide this.
              One may use the SampleSequenceContainer, but any which
              way one provides the SampleSequence interface would work.
<li>Trace - A trace assings a color, Y axis, .. to a SampleSequence,
            and is then added to a chart.
<li>Chart - Plots a bunch of Traces.
</ul>
