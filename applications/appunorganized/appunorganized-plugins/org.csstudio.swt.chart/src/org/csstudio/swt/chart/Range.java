/** A value range, low...high.
 *  <p>
 *  In principle, it's obviously often nicer to pass a min...max range
 *  of values around as a Range object instead of having to deal with
 *  individual doubles.
 *  But there is one catch:
 *  When some object hands out a reference to its range, something like
 *  axis.getValueRange(), then there is the danger that the caller might
 *  change that range and thus affect the internal state of the axis,
 *  instead of going though a designated setValueRange() or setValueMin()
 *  method which would allow the axis to react to the change...
