The UML diagrams under doc/ require the Eclipse UML2 Tools.

To add them via the update manager from within the IDE:
Help/Install New Software...
Main Eclipse site (at that time http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo).
Select Modeling/UML2 Tools
Dependencies were downloaded automatically.

I had bad experience with using the update manager in other cases
when adding profiling or SWT debug tools. The IDE was garbage afterwards
and my best fix was a re-install. The addition of UML2 Tools, however,
worked out OK.
