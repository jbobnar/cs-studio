/** GUI Update throttle
 *  <p>
 *  Assume that the GUI sometimes receives an update that should be
 *  processed right away.
 *  At other times it receives a burst of updates, where it would
 *  be best to wait a little and then redraw to show "everything"
 *  instead of reacting to each single update right away
 *  which only results in flicker and may even be much slower overall.
 *  <p>
 *  This class delays the first update a little bit,
 *  so in case it's a burst, those updates accumulate.
 *  Then it updates, and suppresses further updates for a while
 *  to limit flicker.
 *  Finally, it starts over.
