/** Thread for executing a (system) command.
 *  On Unix, that could be anything in the PATH.
 *  <p>
 *  Several things can happen:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Command finishes OK right away
 *  <li>Command gives error right away
 *  <li>Command runs for a long time, eventually giving error or OK.
 *  </ul>
 *  The command executor waits a little time to see if the command
 *  finishes, and calls back in case of an error.
 *  When the command finishes right away OK or runs longer,
 *  we leave it be.
